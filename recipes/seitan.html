    <h2>Delicious Vegan Meat Option</h2>
    <p>
      Seitan is a hearty, protein-rich meat alternative made primarily from
      vital wheat gluten, prized for its chewy, satisfying texture. To prepare
      it, vital wheat gluten is mixed with flavorful ingredients like
      nutritional yeast, garlic powder, soy sauce, and vegetable broth to form a
      firm dough. The dough is kneaded briefly to develop its signature texture,
      then shaped and gently simmered or steamed. During cooking, seitan absorbs
      the surrounding flavors, making it an excellent base for a wide range of
      savory dishes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once cooked, seitan can be sliced, marinated, grilled, sautéed, or baked
      depending on the recipe. Its neutral flavor and dense bite make it
      especially versatile, working well in stir-fries, sandwiches, stews, or as
      a plant-based substitute in traditionally meat-centered meals. When
      seasoned well, seitan delivers a rich, umami depth that appeals to both
      vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Dry Mix</li>
      <li>1.5 cups Vital Wheat Gluten</li>
      <li>1 tsp Smoked Paprika</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp Black Pepper</li>
      <li>Wet Mix</li>
      <li>1 can Chickpeas (including the liquid/aquafaba)</li>
      <li>3 tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
      <li>1.5 tsp Marmite/Vegemite</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Balsamic Vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Soy Sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, combine the vital wheat gluten, smoked paprika,
        and black pepper. Stir well so the dry ingredients are evenly
        distributed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chickpeas and their liquid (aquafaba) to a blender or food
        processor. Blend until completely smooth, then mix in the olive oil,
        Marmite or Vegemite, balsamic vinegar, and soy sauce until fully
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir with a
        spoon until a shaggy dough forms, then use your hands to bring it
        together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead the dough for 2–3 minutes until it becomes firm and elastic. Avoid
        over-kneading, as this can make the seitan too dense.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the dough into a log or cut it into smaller portions, depending on
        how you plan to use it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the seitan by gently simmering or steaming it for 45–60 minutes,
        turning occasionally if simmering. Once cooked, remove from heat and let
        it cool before slicing or using in your recipe.
      </li>
    </ol>
